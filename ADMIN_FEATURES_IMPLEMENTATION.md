## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Authentication:**
   - Hardcoded credentials (production should use Firebase Auth with admin role)
   - Session management needed for production

2. **Data Access:**
   - Admin has read/write access to all collections
   - Consider Firestore security rules in production

3. **Recommended Firestore Rules:**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Admin-only access (check custom claims in production)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                          request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
    
    // Users can read their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Users can read their bookings
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId ||
                     request.auth.uid == resource.data.driverId;
    }
    
    // Users can create complaints
    match /complaints/{complaintId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```
