### 2. New Admin Service Method
**Updated:** `lib/services/admin_service.dart`

**New Method:**
```dart
static Stream<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getRecentActivitiesStream()
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches recent data from multiple Firestore collections
- Combines activities from:
  - `bookings` (last 3)
  - `users` where userType=driver and status=pending (last 2)
  - `complaints` (last 2)
  - `feedback` (last 2)
- Sorts all by `createdAt` timestamp
- Returns top 8 activities
- Updates every 5 seconds automatically

---

### 3. Removed Unused Admin Files
**Deleted:**
- ❌ `lib/screens/admin_profile_screen.dart` (Unused)
- ❌ `lib/screens/admin_truck_selection_screen.dart` (Unused)
- ❌ `lib/screens/admin_document_review_screen.dart` (Unused)

**Why:**
- These files were not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- Reduces confusion and keeps code clean
- Profile functionality can be added later if needed

---

### 4. Kept Essential Admin Files
**Active Files:**
- ✅ `admin_login_screen.dart` - Admin authentication
- ✅ `admin_dashboard_screen.dart` - Main dashboard with real-time stats
- ✅ `admin_user_details_screen.dart` - User management & bookings

## 📊 Firestore Requirements

### Collections Must Have:
All collections need a `createdAt` field (Timestamp type):

```javascript
// Example booking
{
  pickupLocation: "Airport",
  dropoffLocation: "Downtown",
  fare: 180,
  status: "completed",
  createdAt: Timestamp.now() // REQUIRED
}

// Example driver
{
  name: "John Smith",
  userType: "driver",
  status: "pending",
  createdAt: Timestamp.now() // REQUIRED
}

// Example complaint
{
  subject: "Late arrival",
  userId: "user_id",
  status: "open",
  createdAt: Timestamp.now() // REQUIRED
}

// Example feedback
{
  userName: "Sarah Johnson",
  rating: 5,
  feedback: "Great service",
  createdAt: Timestamp.now() // REQUIRED
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### To Test Recent Activity:

1. **Add Test Booking:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firestore Console → bookings collection
   {
     pickupLocation: "Airport",
     dropoffLocation: "City Center",
     fare: 250,
     status: "completed",
     createdAt: [Timestamp - now]
   }
   ```

2. **Add Test Driver:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firestore Console → users collection
   {
     name: "Test Driver",
     userType: "driver",
     status: "pending",
     email: "driver@test.com",
     createdAt: [Timestamp - now]
   }
   ```

3. **Add Test Complaint:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firestore Console → complaints collection
   {
     userName: "Test User",
     subject: "Service issue",
     description: "Problem description",
     status: "open",
     createdAt: [Timestamp - now]
   }
   ```

4. **Add Test Feedback:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firestore Console → feedback collection
   {
     userName: "Happy Customer",
     rating: 5,
     feedback: "Excellent service!",
     createdAt: [Timestamp - now]
   }
   ```

5. **View on Dashboard:**
   - Login as admin
   - See activities appear in "Recent Activity" section
   - Activities auto-refresh every 5 seconds

### Suggested Firestore Indexes:
```

Collection: feedback
Fields: createdAt (Descending)
```

To change refresh interval, update:
```dart
// In admin_service.dart
Stream.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 5)) // Change seconds here
```

---

## 📝 Code Structure

### Dashboard Activity Section:
```dart
StreamBuilder<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>(
  stream: AdminService.getRecentActivitiesStream(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Handle loading, error, empty states
    // Display activities
  }
)
```

### Activity Card Builder:
```dart
_buildActivityCardFromData(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
  // Determines activity type
  // Sets title, description, color, icon

  // Returns activity card widget
}
```
